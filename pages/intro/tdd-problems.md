# TDD Problems

<v-clicks>

## It's not all perfect of course

**There are some hurdles...**

<v-clicks>

- Chonky refactors 🛠️
- Fragility ❤️‍🩹
- Getting stuck 😫
- How to start? 😕
- Complex setup blocks 🫤
- Integration file names 🤔

<!--
- Chonk => big updates to structure and implementation can mean updating lots of unit tests
- Fragile => if not well designed, one production-code change impacts many tests - need clean tests
  - Tests should conform to SRP and SOC so that the fewest tests fail when we change requirements
  - Unclear if/where bugs are
- Stuck => hit a point where iteration doesn't work, need to reimplement whole thing
- Starting => get confused about the first test or next test to write
- Integration => how to structure them, not like unit tests
