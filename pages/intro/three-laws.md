# How does TDD Help?

**The three laws**

<v-clicks>

1. 🙈 Write no production code without a failing test
2. 🙊 Only write enough of a test to fail
3. 🐵 Only write enough code to pass the test

</v-clicks>

The process...

<style>
  .rgf {
    height: 140px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
</style>

<!--
Follow the laws to ensure standards. Then the process on top of that

1. Define a problem
2. Solve the problem
3. Make it hight quality

- We don't write more code than we need to
- We're focused on end results
- Tests are "first class" and get due consideration
- Cleaning up is built into the process
- It's not possible for production code to drive tests
