<!--
- We want the code to be almost self documenting - so it's easier to understand
- Longevity - We want to follow good clean code practices
  - So our code can scale
  - e.g. dependency inversion principle
  - concretions (e.g. implementations) can drive the abstraction
  - e.g. callback function good example of this
- Flexibility - Quick value releases
  - Make changes with less risk
  - adding new features
  - cleaning to prevent rot
