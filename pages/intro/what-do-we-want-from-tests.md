## What about tests?

How can tests help us get what we want from code?

<v-clicks>

- 🧼 **Prevent code rot**
- 💥 **Prevent need for large changes**
- 🙈 **Catching defects early**
- 🤖 **Reduce manual labour**
- 👨‍🎨 **Act as a low level design language**
- 😎 **Give confidence to change code**

<!--
- Rot => we should be doing regular housekeeping, not let high complexity slip in
- Large changes => Avoid need for "big refactor" of the crazy code
- Defects => Tests are comprehensive enough to catch defects
- Labour => Debugging is time wasted. Manual QA is costly
- Language => Give examples of how to use code in all states. Explain the use cases
- Confidence => Trust our tests enough to refactor. Create new files as part of refactoring without needing to go change all our tests
