# Demo time

<v-clicks>

## Let's use TDD to write a function

<br />

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- Function returns prime factors of a number
- Accepts a number and returns prime factors in an array

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

**Function signature**

```ts
primeFactors(n: number): number[]
```

**Tip**

> As the tests get more specific, the code gets more generic

</v-clicks>

Hopefully this will go smooth
We'll mob program it!
